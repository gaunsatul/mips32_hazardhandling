# mips32_hazardhandling
The MIPS 32-bit CPU, known for its efficiency faces hazards in its pipeline, slowing down the processor. Our task is to find and fix these hazards using a forwarding unit in the Verilog code. The goal is to make the MIPS CPU work better by eliminating the hazards and thereby improving performance.

Reference to the user:

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sources_1/new
Has the Link for both with Forwarding and Without Forwarding Unit.

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sources_1/new/mips_without_fwd.v
Is the code which faces errors.

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sim_1/new
Location has all the test bench codes.

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sim_1/new/tb1_mips_Nfwd.v
Is the Testbench code for Without Forwarding Unit

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sources_1/new/mips_with_fwd.v
Is the code in which we introduce a forwarding unit removing the errors.

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sim_1/new/tb2_mips_fwd.v
Location of the First Testbench With forwarding unit

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sim_1/new/tb3_mips_fwd.v
Location of the Second Testbench With forwarding unit

-> MIPS_hazard_handling.srcs/sim_1/new/tb4_mips_fwd.v
Location of the Third Testbench With forwarding unit
