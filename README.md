# mips32_hazardhandling
The MIPS 32-bit CPU, known for its efficiency faces hazards in its pipeline, slowing down the processor. Our task is to find and fix these hazards using a forwarding unit in the Verilog code. The goal is to make the MIPS CPU work better by eliminating the hazards and thereby improving performance.
